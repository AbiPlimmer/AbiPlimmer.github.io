               Subduction is one of the most fundamental processes on Earth, linking the lithosphere and mantle and is a key driving force in mantle circulation. Despite this, and the advancement of geophysical methods which allow us to better understand mantle dynamics, our understanding of slab behaviour is still limited. The Earth is a very complex system, and so conclusions regarding slab dynamics are also sensitive to the interplay between countless processes acting within the mantle.  </p>

                There is much to learn about slab sinking in the mantle from considering a single 'perfect' plate, such that the dynamics can be isolated from any pre-established or distal processes. We present a range of 3D spherical mantle circulation models which evolve from the initial condition, driven by a 'perfect' plate at the surface. Each of these plates comprises a rectangular geometry, bound by a subduction zone on one side, a spreading ridge on the opposite side, and two tranform faults on the adjacent edges. We vary the geometry of the plate, both in terms of the length of the subducting trench, and the distance from the trench to the ridge, and vary the plate velocity. </p>
            <p class = "paragraph-text">
                We will report the slab behaviour in terms of plate geometry, mantle properties, and plate velocity, focussing on the evolution of downwellings, upwellings and other mantle structures in response to mantle circulation models driven solely by a single plate at the surface.

               The Earth's surface and deep interior are closely linked by transfer of energy and material in the form of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes. While there is a strong feedback between plate tectonics and dynamics of the upper mantle, the dynamics near the core-mantle boundary (CMB) are less well understood. At present, two large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) exist beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, covering roughly 20-30% of the CMB. Some studies suggest a spatial relationship between LLSVPs and subduction zones at the surface, whilst other studies propose that LLSVPs have remained stable for hundreds of millions of years. Additionally, the edges of LLSVPs have often been proposed as plume generation zones, highlighting the importance of these deep mantle structures across the a mantle circulation cycle. </p>
            <p class = "paragraph-text">
                We present 3D spherical global circulation models which aim to contribute to the discussion regarding LLSVP stability and capacity to generate plumes. These simulations are driven at the surface by plate motion histories which utilise different reference frames, which we modify to systematically vary the plate velocities. Additionally, we vary CMB temperature, mantle viscosity and, in some of these models, implement a primordial layer of varying densities. Through this we aim to better understand the importance of plate tectonics relative to intrinsic mantle properties on shaping deep mantle structures and, in turn, the extent to which plate tectonics may control the location of upwellings. </p>

               The relationship between the lithosphere and the mantle during the supercontinent cycle is complex and poorly constrained. The processes which drive dispersal are often simplified to two end members: slab pull and plume push. We aim to explore how lithosphere structure during supercontinent assembly may affect the interaction of deep mantle structures throughout the supercontinent cycle. We consider supercontinental lithosphere structure as one of many potential processes which may affect the evolution of upwellings and downwellings and therefore systematically vary the properties of continental and cratonic lithosphere, respectively within our 3D spherical simulations. </p>
            <p class = "paragraph-text">
                The viscosity and thickness of the lithosphere alters the dip and trajectory of downwelling material beneath the supercontinent as it assembles. Focusing on Pangea, we observe that plumes evolve and are swept beneath the centre of the supercontinent by circum-continental subduction. The proximity of these upwelling and downwelling structures beneath the supercontinent interior varies with lithosphere structure. Where slabs impinge on the top of an evolving plume head (when continental and cratonic lithosphere are thick and viscous in our simulations), the cold slabs can reduce the magnitude of an evolving plume. Conversely,  when the continental lithosphere is thin and weak in our simulations, slab dips shallow in the upper mantle and descend adjacent to the evolving plume, sweeping it laterally near the core-mantle boundary. These contrasting evolutions alter the magnitude of the thermal anomaly and the degree to which the plume can thin the lithosphere prior to breakup. </p>
