             Throughout my time at Cardiff University I have facilitated teaching on a range of undergraduate modules. I am committed to creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment which encourages students to become independent learners, and have explored this through my participation in the AdvanceHE-accredited Cardiff University Education Associate Fellow Programme.
